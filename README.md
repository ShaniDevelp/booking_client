# Hotel Booking Frontend
This repository contains the frontend code for a hotel booking website, built using React. The frontend interacts with the backend APIs to provide a user interface for managing users, rooms, bookings, and other functionalities required for a hotel booking system.

# Technologies Used
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
React Router: A routing library for React applications.
